            <h3>Web dev, 1 week in.</h3> 
            <article>  <p>  For a long time, i have wanted to make a website. I have attempted to create one on a number of occasions, but those attempts were always half-hearted and failed after only a few days. I decided that i wanted to actually create one properly and somehow i found the Codecadamy site where they teach various languages of the web. Now i could have used a service that gives templates to fill in, but that isn’t something i liked the idea of doing and i thought the challenge of creating a site from nothing would be a fun task to complete. </p>

                <p>I started learning HTML and it was super easy so i thought that making a website won’t actually be that hard. It can be done purely through HTML and that is that. Unfortunately, HTML sites look terrible, so i needed to learn CSS. CSS isn’t terribly hard to grasp the principles of, but there is so much versatility that it starts to become much harder to create something. It didn’t help that i have no idea what i can put into the site. Of course ill have a blog and projects and an about page but ive not done many projects as making the site is the first project i wanted to attempt. Not having anything to put up does make the design portion difficult as im designing with very little.  </p>

                <p>I spent about half a week learning what i could of HTML and CSS and somewhat happened upon creating a site. It just had very little in there. I then spent the second half of that week applying what i knew to the website and it got me nowhere. Well, almost nowhere. I am currently just over a week in and i have nothing yet for a site. But i have gone through countless designs and when i started the actual creation i thought what i knew was sufficient, It wasn’t even the tip of the iceberg. Its a long road ahead, im attempting to learn Java scrip and its another, bigger language that ill need so that when i have a good idea for a design, i can actually make it. </p>
